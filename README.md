This branch is set up to investigate E_nbr issues and only for testing purposes. 
There is a subtle variation, instead of outputting pair interaction energies, pair distance our output. Everything else is exactly the same, even the title of data files are the same so Enbr files or pair_Ene files will contain distance instead of energies.
